Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. 
The ultimate objective of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human languages in a valuable way. 
This involves the ability of computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. 
In order to achieve this, NLP combines computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning models.
